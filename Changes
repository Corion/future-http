    . Attempt to be more compatible with older versions of HTTP::Tiny
      Those older versions are distributed with Perl 5.12.x etc, so

      core module.

0.03 20160523
    . Tighten prerequisites
      We need Future 0.33 now
      Actually, likely anything above 0.26 will work, but I'm too lazy to
      find out which versions work.
    . Support Mojolicious as backend

0.02 20160520
    . Fix test suite
