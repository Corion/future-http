    + Silence warning when using Mojolicious
      Thanks to pplu and Grinnz for reporting it and the diagnosis
      This addresses https://github.com/Corion/future-http/issues/2
    ! The response body is now always decoded like HTTP::Message->decoded_content
      If you need access to the raw, undecoded content, please tell me
    . Switch from including Test::HTTP::LocalServer to loading it as
      a test prerequisite

    ! 3xx status codes are not treated as errors anymore
    . Common code was moved into a Role
	+ Support for HTTP::Tiny::Paranoid
	+ Support for IO::Async / Net::Async::HTTP

    . Only test changes, no need to upgrade
	. Split up the backend test into separate files to avoid trying to reload
	  an identical module during the test run(s)

    . We want AnyEvent::Future 0.02 minimum
	+ Actually return a "true" message when failing in HTTP::Future::Mojo

    . Old versions of HTTP::Tiny don't have some features, defang the tests
      appropriately.

0.04 20160523
    . Attempt to be more compatible with older versions of HTTP::Tiny
      Those older versions are distributed with Perl 5.12.x etc, so
      compatibility with them allows us not to require an upgrade of the
      core module.

0.03 20160523
    . Tighten prerequisites
      We need Future 0.33 now
      Actually, likely anything above 0.26 will work, but I'm too lazy to
      find out which versions work.
    . Support Mojolicious as backend

0.02 20160520
    . Fix test suite

0.01 20160516
    . Released on an unsuspecting world
